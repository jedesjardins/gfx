# gfx

A single file Open Source C++ wrapper for [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), for abstracting away boilerplate, and easing use.

## Quick and Easy Guide



## Usage

This is an .hpp only library, so if you have the single file header in your include path, along with it's dependencies, it should be plug and play. More information can be found [here](docs/usage.md)

## API

There are three main parts of this library: [the json configuration file for your project](docs/json_configuration.md), [the RenderConfig class](docs/render_config.md), and [the Renderer class](docs/render_device.md)
